## Support
Currently we don't consider supporting Android 4.x, it supports Android 5.0 ～ 12.0.

If conditions permit, downgrade targetSdkVersion to 28 or below for better compatibility.

***Stability has not been tested extensively and is for learning and communication purposes only Please do not use for other purposes***

## Special Instruction

This project distinguishes between 32-bit and 64-bit, it was compiled to 2 different demos. If you can not find your target in application list, please use another architecture.

## Usage
### Step 1.Add initialized code in the Application

```java
    @Override
    protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
        super.attachBaseContext(base);
        try {
            BlackBoxCore.get().doAttachBaseContext(base, new ClientConfiguration() {
                @Override
                public String getHostPackageName() {
                    return base.getPackageName();
                }
            });
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        BlackBoxCore.get().doCreate();
    }
```

### Step 2.Install application
```java
    // Use package name to install provided that application has been install on device
    BlackBoxCore.get().installPackageAsUser("com.tencent.mm", userId);
    
    // Use APK path to install provided that application has not been install on device
    BlackBoxCore.get().installPackageAsUser(new File("/sdcard/com.tencent.mm.apk"), userId);
```

### Step 3.Launch application
```java
   BlackBoxCore.get().launchApk("com.tencent.mm", userId);
```

### App Cloner

### Fake Location

Fake location base theory: forbid WPS(Wi-Fi Positioning System) and LBS(MPS), only provide modified GPS location server.

### Fake Device Info
Modify device info in source code, ui isn't available

* Xiaomi device tested successfully.
* Huawei device tested failed, it need to be enhanced.

### API
#### Get application list that were installed in BlackBox
```java
   // flags can refer to the Android develop documentation
   BlackBoxCore.get().getInstalledApplications(flags, userId);
   
   BlackBoxCore.get().getInstalledPackages(flags, userId);
```

#### Get user information in BlackBox
```java
   List<BUserInfo> users = BlackBoxCore.get().getUsers();
```
If you want to perform more operations, please refer to the source code.


#### Xposed Support
- BlackBox has supported Xposed Modules.
- BlackBox has hidden Xposed Framework, [Xposed Checker](https://www.coolapk.com/apk/190247) and [XposedDetector](https://github.com/vvb2060/XposedDetector) can't detect it.
